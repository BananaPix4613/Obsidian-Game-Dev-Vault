## To-Do

- [ ] Create event subscribing methods to detect events done with enchantments
- [ ] Create methods for handling experience
- [ ] Create tooltip handling to display enchantment levels
- [ ] Create custom commands to set and add attunement experience to held item
- [ ] Create an event (particle + sound + etc) that occurs upon enchantment level up
- [ ] Get custom enchantment table UI to display instead of vanilla UI
- [ ] Create a design page to outline how the research mechanic should work and how many runes should exist
- [ ] Debug loot tables to make sure their contents respect the single level enchantments
- [ ] Create functionality that'll revert any existing enchants prior to the mod being installed to avoid old enchantments causing conflicts
- [ ] Create item sprites for the page and book of attunement
- [ ] Create a spreadsheet to organize what runes every item should have
- [ ] Create a quick tool to convert the rune spreadsheet to JSON to be read by the mod
- [ ] Prototype a navigable map-like UI using the mouse to scroll across it for enchantment application
- [ ] Find a way to dynamically create nodes from viable enchantments to create scalability
- [ ] Make nodes buttons whose tooltips show the enchantment icon, name, and three required materials plus their quantity
- [ ] Make the tooltip recipe adjust to show either red X's or green check marks according to if the player's current inventory contains those items
- [ ] Make it so if the node is selected and pressed while the player has the corresponding items for the recipe to consume said items and disable the node
